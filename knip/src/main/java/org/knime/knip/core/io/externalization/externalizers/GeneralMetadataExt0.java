 *  ECLIPSE and the GNU GPL Version 3 applying for KNIME, provided the
 *  license terms of ECLIPSE themselves allow for the respective use and
 *  propagation of ECLIPSE together with KNIME.
 *
 *  Additional permission relating to nodes for KNIME that extend the Node
 *  Extension (and in particular that are based on subclasses of NodeModel,
 *  NodeDialog, and NodeView) and that only interoperate with KNIME through

 *  Nodes are deemed to be separate and independent programs and to not be
